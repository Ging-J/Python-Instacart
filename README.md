# Python - Instacart Anaylsis

Includes a population flow diagram, documentation of steps taken for data consistency and wrangling using Python, derived columns, performed analysis, generated visualizations, and sent recommendations to the client.

Objective

Instacart, an online grocery store with strong sales, wants to dig deeper into their sales patterns. The objective was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis to gain further insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation.

Key Questions

The sales team needs to know:

What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day (i.e., when the most orders are placed) to schedule ads during less busy times?
Are there specific times of the day when people spend the most money, influencing the types of products to advertise then?
With a variety of product prices, how can simpler price range groupings be used to direct marketing and sales efforts?
Which product types are more popular, and which departments have the highest frequency of product orders?

Additionally, they are interested in customer behavior:

Whatâ€™s the distribution of brand loyalty among users (i.e., how often they return to Instacart)?
Are there differences in ordering habits based on customer loyalty status, region, age, and family status?
What classifications can be made based on demographic information such as age, income, types of goods, and family status?
What differences exist in the ordering habits of different customer profiles, considering order price, frequency, and product types?

Data

The datasets used include:

Customers

The project files are organized as follows:

01 Project Management: Project brief
02 Data: Original Data (raw data) and Prepared Data (cleaned and prepared data) (Note: Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size limitations)
03 Scripts: Jupyter notebooks containing the analysis code
04 Analysis: Visualizations used for developing and explaining insights
05 Sent to Client: Final report presented in Excel

Resources

Note: Instacart is a real company that made their data available online. However, the content of this project brief was created by CareerFoundry for the purpose of this analysis.
